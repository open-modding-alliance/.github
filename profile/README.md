# 🙋‍♀️ OPEN MODDING ALLIANCE
At it's core, Open Modding Alliance is about sharing tools, knowledge and assets for Farming Simulator mods. 

**Our Manifesto:** Be kind. Share your knowledge. Help your fellow modders. 

### 🌈 Want to Contribute?
Collaboration is the heart of the alliance and we want you to contribute. There is currently four ways you can do this:

4. ❤️ Spread the word and use our assets! 

## 📚 Community SDK
This is our effort to bridge the gap between the official Giants Developer Network and the knowledge spread throughout the FS modding community. Sort of an FS modding knowledgebase and FS LUA Reference Library.

- **Script Library** (install | documentation)
- **FS Build tool** (install | documentation)
- **[LUA Reference Library](/open-modding-alliance/CommunitySDK)**
  - Script Bindings
  - Undocumented functions
  - Global Tables
  - Known Classes
  - Can-I-Uset-It _(in-game vs Giants Editor vs Lua stand-alone)_
- **Workflow tips & guides**

## Modding Assets

### GUIDES AND TIPS & TRICKS 

### OUR STORY
It all started with a handful of dedicated modders passionate about sharing knowledge and helping each other out, pushing our limits and exploring new posibillites together. Strengthenred by the power of this community and the joy of seeing you fellow modders grow and flourish, we now invite like minded people to join our alliance of kind, open minded and passionated modders, as well as opening up our assets to the wider FS modding community. You don't even need to add assets to our GitHub, simply by using our assets and spreading the word we all contribute to an even stronger FS modding community. The goal is simply to have more modders, better mods and a thriving community.
